  This app will launch a [COMSOL Multiphysics] GUI on the [Katana cluster]. You
  will be able to interact with the COMSOL GUI through a VNC session.
   
  **NOTE** You will need to belong to the group that owns the license to use 
  COMSOL. If you don't belong to that group, the job will start successfully 
  in OnDemand and Katana/PBS, then fail on Katana and the job will disappear 
  in OnDemand.
